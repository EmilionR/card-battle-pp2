# CARD BATTLE

![Project-image]()

Card battle is simple card game which, despite its simplicity, challenges the player's brain.

This is a game for people who want something quick and simple that still makes you think.

The goal is to predict the opponent's move and choose the right card to go higher or lower at the right time to win the turn and collect the points.

The game offers a bit of variety in terms of difficulty and round length.
